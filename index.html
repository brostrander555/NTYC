                            <p class="paragraph-light">My name is Shalin. I live in Weaverville, NC with my husband, my three babies, and my sweetheart puppy, Oona. I was looking for somewhere to sell the nice things I’ve accumulated over the years that I just don’t use anymore.
                                I also wanted a place to find new things, at least new to me, for a great price. When I couldn’t find this place, I decided I would forge it myself. I knew I couldn’t be the only one looking for this place, right? <br>Unsold
                                items that are marked for donation will be donated to some local charities. If you know of any local charities that could use adult clothing items, please let us know! Our goal is to help locals shop and sell for a great
                                price, and to give back to our community. <br>So if you have any charities to recommend, please email us at <a href="mailto:newtoyouconsignmentsale@gmail.com" target="_blank">newtoyouconsignmentsale@gmail.com</a><br>We
                                can’t wait to meet you! <br></p>

            <p class="paragraph-4">Each consignor pays a fee of $10. This will be docked from the check that is mailed out to each consignor after the sale. <br>(Note: Checks will be mailed out within 14 days after the conclusion of the sale.)<br><br><strong><em>Click on our link to become a consignor.</em> </strong><br>Once
                you register, you will receive a set “<em>Consignor Number</em>”. <br>This will be your number for the sale. Once registered, you’ll be able to login and begin entering items you would like to consign. Each consignor will have 100 item
                limit, and a limit of 10 pairs of shoes. <br>‍<br><strong><em>Click “Menu” - “work with consigned inventory”- “add items” You then can begin to “add new” items to your list.</em></strong> Pretty simple!<br> Once you have completed entering
                all the items you wish to sell, you can print your tags. <br><strong><em><br>Please print on card stock. </em></strong><br><em>(This is more durable and more likely to stay securely on your items.) </em><br>Please safety pin your tags
                to your clothing on the top left of the item with the hanger in the shape of a question mark (?). <br>This allows all the items to be facing the same way and makes the shopping experience for everyone go smoothly. <br>Please securely tape
                the tag to any home decor items being sold. Shoes must be zip tied together so they are not separated.<br> <br><strong>Again please make sure your tags are secured to your items!</strong><br>‍<br>The dates of our next sale are down below
                with the specifics of when and where to drop off your items to sell. We will be holding our sale at the WNC AG CENTER- which is a 5000 square-foot building. Go to our contact page for the address! <br><br></p>
